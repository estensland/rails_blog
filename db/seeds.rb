Post.create(title: "Welcome to my blog!", body: "I have survived years working at a summer camp, earning my masters in history, Dev Bootcamp, and now found a job. I think it is time to try out a blog. If you are open to my web development eurekas, random historical content, or the occasional essai, you might be able to tolerate this with minimal effort.")
Post.create(title: "Career Search", body: "<p>The ending of Dev Bootcamp was an odd and unexpected transition. Structure upon structure let way to...nothing. The 12 + hours of coding a day let way to...whatever I wanted. </p> <p>Job week was a welcome addition to the curriculum, but it for me was the most stressful week of the whole ten by far. After weeks of relying on myself and others in my cohort, suddenly my fate was in the hands of employers, people that I had never met. As much as we learned about cold outreach, positive networking, and other tips to find jobs, so much of it was left to chance. This was not something I was ready to accept after pushing myself to learn and embrace an entirely new skill set in 9 weeks. </p> <p>But, as little as I liked it, it was what it was. All that was left was to make the best of it.</p> <p>I had recieved tips from previous graduates that it was important to keep coding. So, iI tried to strike a balance between coding and job-search, which helped keep me sane and reminded that the focus was coding.</p> <p>In the end, it took me just over three weeks to get a job offer. I graciously accepted and have been a respectible member of society for a few weeks now. For those of you graduating from DBC, learn from my experiences. Here is some advice for starting your career search as career week starts:</p> <ol> <li>CODE. This might seem obvious but it won't be. After programming in HTML, Javascript, and working routes in Rails for three weeks, it is surprising how rusty your Algorithimic skills can get. You will want a refresher before coding challenges and technical interviews start up. Try Project Euler for practice with complex problems, and Exercism.io to solve coding challenges and have them peer reviewed. This will help with the next point...</li> <li>Commit to Git and keep a streak going while you search: It gives a vibe of an active coder. Exercism.io is a great way to do this, as they instruct you to have a git repo for it anyway. Make your activity graph all nice and pretty. It doesn't have to be much, just a few commits a day. Speaking of GitHub...</li> <li>Clean your GitHub up. Get rid of the million random DBC projects you haven't touched in weeks and aren't sure what they even are. Don't kill everything of course, but if something is worth saving, add a Readme and let a visitor know that you meant for them to see it. Like an author writing a book, everything needs a reason to be there.</li> <li>Twitter and LinkedIn: Make accounts if you don't have them. For Twitter, tweet one or two tech-based things at some friends. Employers will want to see that your twitter exists, is not totally empty, and is void of offensive things. If you aren't a twitter type, bear in mind that your goal is to make a twitter account to avoid raising red flags, not necessarily get you a job. For LinkedIn, just make an account (Don't let it mass email your gmail contacts...please do not do this unless you want every person, including spammers and craiglisters invited to your profile). Wait to get tips on LinkedIn during carreer week, but at least have an account ready to go Monday. </li> <li>Quantity vs. Quality: The debate rages. Some boots do the 'spray and pray' method of applying to every job they can find like crazy, and hoping one sticks. I know boots who got jobs this way, and I know boots who wasted weeks this way. Other boots get really focused on a couple companies, having informational interviews with employees, twitter-stalking, blog-reading, etc. I know boots who got jobs this way, and I know boots who wasted weeks this way. It really in the end is going to come down to chance, not only if a company is looking to hire, but how much 'quality' other applicants put in. The best analogy I have is the running from a cheetah...you don't have to try to outrun the cheetah, just the other people. Spend your time like an investor spends money, by weighing the risk against potential reward. If you think you have a good chance with a company, invest time. If they are not hiring right now, spend just the amount of time needed to keep your name in their mind.</li> <li>Be Yourself: Most important. You are promoting your brand so figure out what that it is. Most companies seem to hire for culture fit at entry level (I'd say that the bulk DBC grads are plus or minus close enough that coding skills can't readily distinguish) Don't chase jobs where you don't fit in, and show ones where you do how much you do. As painful as it is, in the end the job hunt will come down to at least a little luck. A lot of new companies take a long time to hire, and it will depend on when in their capital-raising process you talk with them.</li> <li>Keep Calm: It will not be easy, and many if not all boots have failed at this. But the more you can keep focused, listen to the carreer team, code, meet, investigate, and apply, the better you will be.</li> </ol><p>So, go to carreer week where many of the above will be covered in far better and clearer detail. But hopefully, with these tips, you can get these out of the way first and be able to absorb more important skills and techniques, instead of being like me who fumbled around with basic things like creating LinkedIn and Twitter accounts. Spend your time at carreer week making a great LinkedIn, not waiting for LinkedIn account confirmation emails. Once career week is over, spend mornings coding, afternoons applying, vice-versa, or any schedule that fits you and go with it. Employers are out there, help them meet you.</p>")
